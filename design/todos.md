# general
## 1
- ellipsis in the middle of text instead of at the end
    - will need to do some manual logic. right now using the css's default text overflow
- more styled scrollbar with larger width
- thumbnail zooming
- ability to make copies of items
- "undoing selections" system, for accidentally deselecting or selecting something incorrectly
- have recently moved items be some colour for a while before fading away
- see if can adjust the drag sensitivity, but maybe not, since with explorer it is still pretty sensitive
- when making the real drop arrow, make it pretty visible since the dragged ghost image kind of obscures it

## 2
- fix some slight flashing when reordering
- deselect button instead of just keyboard key

## 3
- remove button for group
- animations/transitions for css
- some sort of response for hovering over thumbnails
    - maybe fade them out a little and make it bluish?
- drop arrow when dragging over group title
- az sort should toggle between reverse and not reverse until a movement has been made, where it should do non reverse first
    - different icons for az sort state
- selected proxy box X icon could be better

## 4
- plan preview system from double click
    - maybe open default preview program
    - or custom preview program with fast ability to close
- shift selection system

## 5
- redesign "drag in items" text to be something instead of just a line of text
- group reordering
- faded white background to show the image being dragged when dragging single image
- slight blue or green background when dragging over another image (together with the green arrow)
    - not too dark, need to be able to see the image being dragged over
    - just the green arrow seems too non-visble, at least right now with the thin green arrow
- dont show green arrow when dragging over self, since dropping on self does nothing

# image loading
- how to handle video files as thumbnails
- dragged in images have no faded out drag preview for some reason
