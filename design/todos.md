# general
## 1
- ellipsis in the middle of text instead of at the end
    - will need to do some manual logic. right now using the css's default text overflow
- more styled scrollbar with larger width
- thumbnail zooming
- ability to make copies of items
- "undoing selections" system, for accidentally deselecting or selecting something incorrectly
- have recently moved items be some colour for a while before fading away
- see if can adjust the drag sensitivity, but maybe not, since with explorer it is still pretty sensitive
- when making the real drop arrow, make it pretty visible since the dragged ghost image kind of obscures it

## 2
- fix some slight flashing when reordering
- deselect button instead of just keyboard key

## 3
- remove button for group
- do some animations/transitions for css
- some sort of response for hovering over thumbnails
    - maybe fade them out a little and make it bluish?
- drop arrow when dragging over group title
- az sort should toggle between reverse and not reverse until a movement has been made, where it should do non reverse first
    - different icons for az sort state
- selected proxy box X icon could be better

## 4
- plan preview system from double click
    - maybe open default preview program
    - or custom preview program with fast ability to close

# image loading
- how to handle video files as thumbnails

# next steps (issue tracked)
- border around image group when dragging over files
    - normal drag borders should not appear
- drag items into new group zone to create new group with items
- use natural sort for group az sort
- right click to insert here, for when scrolling far away to insert?
    - or perhaps something at the bottom to represent the selected items, and can just drag that?
